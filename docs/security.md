# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security features and best practices implemented in the FastAPI Bootstrap project.

## Overview

The FastAPI Bootstrap project implements multiple layers of security to protect your application and infrastructure:

1. **Network Security**: VPC with public and private subnets
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protection against common web exploits
3. **Least Privilege IAM Policies**: Fine-grained access control
4. **Secure Configuration Management**: Using SSM Parameter Store
5. **Encryption**: KMS encryption for sensitive data
6. **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS for all traffic

## Network Security

The application is deployed within a VPC with the following security features:

- **Public Subnets**: Only contain the Application Load Balancer
- **Private Subnets**: Contain the ECS tasks, isolated from direct internet access
- **Security Groups**: Restrict traffic between components
  - ALB Security Group: Only allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet
  - ECS Security Group: Only allows traffic from the ALB on the application port

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

AWS WAF is configured to protect the application from common web exploits:

- **AWS Managed Rules**: Pre-configured rule sets that protect against common threats
  - Core rule set (CRS): Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  - Known bad inputs: Protection against known malicious inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS attacks by limiting requests per IP
- **Custom Rules**: Can be added for application-specific protection

## IAM Least Privilege

IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege:

- **ECS Task Execution Role**: Limited to pulling container images and writing logs
- **ECS Task Role**: Limited to accessing only the specific AWS services needed
- **Resource-Based Policies**: Restrict access to specific resources by naming convention
  - SSM parameters: Only parameters under `/${app_name}/${environment}/`
  - CloudWatch logs: Only log groups under `/ecs/${app_name}-${environment}`

## Secure Configuration Management

Sensitive configuration is managed securely using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Parameters organized by application and environment
- **Encryption**: All sensitive parameters encrypted with KMS
- **Access Control**: IAM policies restrict access to specific parameters
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Application retrieves secrets at runtime

Example parameter hierarchy:
```
/fastapi-bootstrap/dev/database/url
/fastapi-bootstrap/dev/api/secret_key
```

## Encryption

Data encryption is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Data at Rest**: 
  - CloudWatch Logs: Encrypted with KMS
  - SSM Parameters: Encrypted with KMS
  - S3 (Terraform state): Server-side encryption
  
- **Data in Transit**:
  - HTTPS for all external traffic
  - VPC for internal traffic

## HTTPS Configuration

All traffic to the application is served over HTTPS:

- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: Managed through AWS Certificate Manager
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: Automatic redirection of HTTP requests
- **Modern TLS Policy**: Using ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 for strong encryption

## Monitoring and Alerting

Security monitoring is implemented through:

- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alerts for suspicious activity
- **WAF Metrics**: Tracking of blocked requests
- **CloudWatch Dashboard**: Visualization of security metrics

## Best Practices for Developers

When extending the application, follow these security best practices:

1. **Never store secrets in code or environment variables**
   - Use SSM Parameter Store for all secrets
   
2. **Validate all user input**
   - Implement input validation at the API level
   
3. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
   - Request only the permissions your code needs
   
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   
5. **Enable security scanning in CI/CD**
   - Add security scanning tools to your CI/CD pipeline

## Security Compliance

The infrastructure is designed to help meet common compliance requirements:

- **Encryption**: Helps meet requirements for data protection
- **Access Control**: Helps meet requirements for access management
- **Logging**: Helps meet requirements for audit trails
- **Network Isolation**: Helps meet requirements for network security

## Future Security Enhancements

Potential security enhancements for future versions:

1. **AWS Security Hub Integration**: Centralized security management
2. **GuardDuty Integration**: Threat detection
3. **AWS Config**: Configuration compliance monitoring
4. **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic monitoring
5. **Enhanced WAF Rules**: Additional custom rules for specific threats
